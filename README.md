# AI Multi-Agent Restaurant Recommendation App üçΩÔ∏è

An intelligent restaurant recommendation system powered by multiple AI agents that helps groups find the perfect dining experience based on location fairness, preferences, and budget.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for input processing, restaurant search, transportation analysis, and output formatting
- **Location-Based Search**: Uses Google Places API to find restaurants near your group
- **Transportation Fairness**: Calculates travel times and fairness scores using Google Distance Matrix API
- **Smart Recommendations**: Considers dietary preferences, budget constraints, and location equity
- **Real-time Data**: Live restaurant information including ratings, reviews, and current status

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The app uses a **LangGraph** multi-agent workflow with four specialized agents:

1. **Input Agent**: Parses user input to extract member locations, preferences, and budget
2. **Restaurant Agent**: Searches for restaurants using Google Places API based on group preferences
3. **Transportation Agent**: Calculates travel times and fairness scores using Google Distance Matrix API
4. **Output Agent**: Formats final recommendations in a readable table format

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**
- **Anthropic API Key** (for Claude AI)
- **Google Maps API Key** (for Places and Distance Matrix APIs)

2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to **API Keys** section
4. Click **"Create Key"**
5. Give your key a name (e.g., "Restaurant App")
6. Copy the generated API key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

### 2. Get a Google Maps API Key
